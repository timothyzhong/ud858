## Setup Instructions
1. Create a project in AppEngine Developer Console[1]
2. Download Google AppEngine launcher[2]
3. In Google AppEngine launcher, load this project. Change 'application' in
   'app.yaml' to the application ID created in step 1.
4. In Developer Console, create credentials. Update CLIENT_ID in 'settings.py'
   and 'static/js/app.js'.
5. In the launcher, run the application locally at http://localhost:8080

## Task1
Sessions are implemented as Session objects and have SessionForm for
input/output. Session objects have websafeConferenceKey property. When
a session is created, the websafeConferenceKey is entered as parent. That
makes it easy to get all sessions in a conference.

Speakers are implemented as a string property in Session object. So each
session has the name of the speaker, which can be used for querying
a session.

## Task3
getSessionsByDuration allows user to provide lower bound and upper bound
of duration and get all sessions with durations within that range.

getSessionsByHighlight allows user to provide one or more highlights that
he/she is interested in, and get a list of sessions that cover those
highlights.

querySessions allows user to query sessions combining different fields.

Query problem: In order to achieve this function, a query that supports
multiple multiple filters should be implemented. StartTime and typeOfSession
should be included in the supported filters. So we can query sessions
with startTime less than 19:00 and typeOfSession not equal to workshop.
